# Notion2Graph

Dear stats lovers, I built something with zero practical value, but my brain has been demanding it for too long.

I wanted a navigable link graph (Obsidian-style) starting from a Notion backup.

* Download your backup from the Notion home page by selecting “Export” with these settings: Markdown, include subpages, create folder for subpages
* Run the script to recursively scan the folders with python notion_graph.py BackupDirectoryPath/ and it will generate notion_links.json containing all page-to-page relationships.
* Open the HTML page and load the JSON file created in the previous step.

**Privacy guarantee**: the script recursively scans for page links only (it ignores the content) and then generates a JSON output to load into the UI.

A few notes:
- It doesn’t handle external links (in my case they were irrelevant).
- It doesn’t handle database pages (same reason).
- YES, it was written with help from Codex.

Result: a real map of chaos, with a few useful insights for cleaning up and reorganizing.

I’ve got 132 nodes and 230 edges. Let me know your metrics too.
